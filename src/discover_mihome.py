#TODO: Placeholder for mihome discovery example app.
#
# This will sit in permanent receive mode and listen for any device id reports,
# and when it sees one that is not in the user registry, it will add it.
#
# This will be useful for building up a user registry that can then be used
# with the control_mihome tester to actually toggle all the switches,
# and with the monitor_mihome to dump all message reports.

# For the moment, you have to seed the registry in control_mihome with a known
# device_id to run the test (perhaps using an older version of the code to learn it).

# This is only a temporary situation until the complete receive pipeline is written.
# But I want to implement this properly, rather than half-hearted.
